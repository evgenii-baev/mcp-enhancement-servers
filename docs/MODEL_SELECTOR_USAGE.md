# Model Selector Usage Guide

The Model Selector is a powerful tool designed to help developers choose the optimal architecture, design pattern, algorithm, or data structure for their programming tasks. This guide explains how to use the Model Selector effectively.

## Overview

The Model Selector analyzes your programming task, considers your constraints and preferences, and recommends the most suitable approaches from its knowledge base. It can help with:

- Selecting architectural patterns for applications
- Choosing appropriate design patterns for specific problems
- Identifying optimal algorithms for data processing
- Recommending data structures for efficient storage and retrieval
- Suggesting paradigms and coding organization approaches

## Capabilities

The Model Selector offers three main capabilities:

1. **select_model**: Recommends models/approaches for a specific task
2. **list_models**: Lists all available models, optionally filtered by category
3. **compare_models**: Compares two or more models side by side

## Usage Examples

### Selecting a Model for a Specific Task

```typescript
// Example: Getting recommendations for a web app architecture
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'select_model',
  parameters: {
    task: 'Build a scalable e-commerce platform',
    context: 'We expect high traffic during sales events and need to handle thousands of concurrent users',
    language: 'TypeScript',
    framework: 'Next.js',
    constraints: ['budget constraints', 'must be cloud-hosted'],
    preferences: ['scalability', 'maintainability', 'performance'],
    projectScale: 'Large'
  }
});

// The response contains:
// - A detailed recommendation in Markdown format
// - An array of the top models with their key properties
console.log(response.data.recommendation);
```

### Choosing an Algorithm for Data Processing

```typescript
// Example: Finding the best algorithm for sorting
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'select_model',
  parameters: {
    task: 'Sort a large dataset of product information',
    context: 'We have millions of product records that need to be sorted by multiple criteria',
    language: 'Java',
    constraints: ['memory usage concerns', 'must complete in under 5 seconds'],
    preferences: ['stability', 'predictable performance']
  }
});
```

### Selecting a Design Pattern

```typescript
// Example: Finding an appropriate design pattern
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'select_model',
  parameters: {
    task: 'Create objects dynamically based on configuration',
    context: 'Our application needs to instantiate different types of report generators at runtime',
    language: 'Python',
    preferences: ['flexibility', 'clean code', 'maintainability']
  }
});
```

### Listing Available Models

```typescript
// Example: Listing all algorithms
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'list_models',
  parameters: {
    category: 'Algorithm'
  }
});

// Get all available categories
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'list_models',
  parameters: {}
});
console.log(response.data.categories);
```

### Comparing Multiple Models

```typescript
// Example: Comparing microservices vs monolithic architecture
const response = await modelSelectorServer.handleRequest({
  capability: 'compare_models',
  parameters: {
    modelNames: ['Microservices', 'Monolithic']
  }
});

// The response contains a structured comparison of the models
console.log(response.data.comparison);
```

## Supported Categories

The Model Selector classifies models into the following categories:

1. **Architecture Models**
   - High-level application structures (Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless)
   - Architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture)

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Creational patterns (Factory, Builder, Singleton)
   - Structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
   - Behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)

3. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, RadixSort)
   - Search algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, A*)
   - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)

4. **Data Structures**
   - Linear structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
   - Tree structures (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees)
   - Hash-based structures (HashMap, HashSet)
   - Graph representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)

5. **Programming Paradigms**
   - Object-Oriented Programming
   - Functional Programming
   - Reactive Programming
   - Event-Driven Programming

6. **Code Organization**
   - Modular programming
   - Domain-Driven Design
   - Component-based development

7. **Other Categories**
   - API Design approaches
   - Concurrency models
   - Testing strategies
   - Optimization techniques

## Best Practices

For the best results from the Model Selector:

1. **Be specific in your task description**: The more detailed your description, the more accurate the recommendations will be.

2. **Provide context**: Explaining the broader context helps the selector understand your needs better.

3. **Specify constraints**: Mention any limitations or requirements that might affect the choice of model.

4. **Include preferences**: If you have preferences for certain qualities (e.g., performance, simplicity), make sure to include them.

5. **Consider trade-offs**: Every model has advantages and disadvantages. Review the recommendations carefully and consider which trade-offs are acceptable for your specific case.

## Integration with AI Coding Assistants

The Model Selector is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. When you're working on a programming task, you can ask the AI to use the Model Selector to recommend the best approach before starting implementation.

Example prompts for an AI coding assistant:

- "Before implementing this search feature, can you use the Model Selector to recommend the best algorithm for searching through 10 million text records?"

- "I need to design a system for handling user authentication. Can you use the Model Selector to suggest the best architectural pattern for this?"

- "What's the most efficient data structure for implementing a cache with fast lookups and automatic expiration of old entries? Please use the Model Selector."

## Conclusion

The Model Selector is a valuable tool for making informed architectural and design decisions. By leveraging its recommendations, you can choose approaches that align with your project's requirements, constraints, and goals, ultimately leading to more effective and maintainable code.

Remember that while the Model Selector provides expert recommendations, the final decision should take into account your team's expertise, project-specific requirements, and other contextual factors.
