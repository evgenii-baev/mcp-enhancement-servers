# MCP Tools Priority and Usage Recommendations

This document describes the recommended order of AI tools based on their priority when solving tasks. The tools are listed in decreasing order of priority and grouped by category.

## Tool Categories and Their Priorities

### 1. Initial Analysis Tools

These tools help determine where to start and which approach to choose:

1. **First Thought Advisor (`first_thought_advisor`)** - Helps select an initial approach to the problem. Use at the earliest stages of working on a task when you need to determine the direction of thinking.

2. **Model Selector (`model_selector`)** - Chooses the optimal model for a specific task. Apply when you need to determine the best algorithm or approach to solve a particular problem.

### 2. Basic Structured Thinking Tools

These tools provide the foundation for structured thinking:

3. **Sequential Thinking (`sequential_thinking`)** - The foundation of the entire thinking process. Use this tool to structure complex tasks into a sequence of steps, create branches of thoughts, and revise previous thoughts.

4. **Mental Model (`mental_model`)** - Applies proven mental models to tasks. Consider this tool when you need to analyze a problem using various cognitive frameworks.

5. **Debugging Approach (`debugging_approach`)** - Systematic approaches to debugging and problem-solving. Use for structured debugging of code, systems, and processes.

### 3. Solution Generation Tools

These tools help generate and optimize solutions:

6. **Brainstorming (`brainstorming`)** - Structured brainstorming for idea generation. Apply when you need to create multiple alternative solutions or approaches.

7. **Stochastic Algorithm (`stochastic_algorithm`)** - Application of stochastic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems. Use for tasks involving uncertainty and optimization.

### 4. Tools for Working with Functions and Requirements

These tools focus on working with features and requirements:

8. **Feature Discussion (`feature_discussion`)** - Structured discussion of features and gathering information about them. Use when working with new features or requirements.

9. **Feature Analyzer (`feature_analyzer`)** - Analysis of features and their characteristics. Apply to assess complexity, identify dependencies, and potential problems in feature implementation.

## Recommendations for Tool Selection

### By Task Type

- **For determining approach**: First Thought Advisor, Model Selector
- **For structured thinking**: Sequential Thinking, Mental Model, Debugging Approach
- **For generating and optimizing solutions**: Brainstorming, Stochastic Algorithm
- **For working with requirements**: Feature Discussion, Feature Analyzer

### By Work Stage

- **Beginning work on a task**: First Thought Advisor, Model Selector
- **Structuring and analysis**: Sequential Thinking, Mental Model, Debugging Approach
- **Solution generation and optimization**: Brainstorming, Stochastic Algorithm
- **Implementation and detailing**: Feature Discussion, Feature Analyzer

## Examples of Using Tools in Combination

### Scenario 1: Solving a Complex Technical Problem

1. Start with `first_thought_advisor` to determine the initial approach
2. Use `model_selector` to choose an appropriate methodology
3. Apply `sequential_thinking` to structure the solution process
4. Use `mental_model` to analyze the problem from different perspectives
5. Apply `debugging_approach` when debugging is necessary
6. Use `stochastic_algorithm` to optimize the solution

### Scenario 2: Developing a New Feature

1. Start with `first_thought_advisor` to determine the general approach
2. Use `feature_discussion` to understand requirements
3. Apply `sequential_thinking` to plan the development process
4. Use `brainstorming` to generate alternative approaches
5. Apply `feature_analyzer` for detailed requirements analysis
6. Finish with `model_selector` to choose specific technologies and architecture

### Scenario 3: Research and Data Analysis

1. Start with `first_thought_advisor` to determine the initial approach
2. Use `model_selector` to choose appropriate analysis models
3. Apply `sequential_thinking` to structure the research process
4. Use `mental_model` to form hypotheses
5. Apply `stochastic_algorithm` for analysis and modeling
6. Finish with `brainstorming` for interpreting results and generating conclusions

## Conclusion

When choosing tools, always consider the context of the task and previous results. The optimal approach is to start with initial analysis tools, then move to structured thinking tools, solution generation, and finally to working with specific requirements. This order provides a natural workflow from general to specific and from conceptual to concrete.
