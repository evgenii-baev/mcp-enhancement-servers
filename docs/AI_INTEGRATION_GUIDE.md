# AI Integration Guide for Mental Models

This guide demonstrates how AI assistants can effectively use the AI integration layer to recommend appropriate mental models for programming tasks.

## Overview

The AI integration layer provides specialized functionality to help AI assistants choose the most relevant mental models for programming tasks. It enriches mental models with metadata specifically designed for AI reasoning, including keywords, problem domains, and code patterns.

## How to Use the AI Model Recommender

When a user presents a programming problem, the AI assistant can leverage the AI Model Recommender to identify the most appropriate mental models to apply.

### Example Workflow

1. User describes a programming problem or task
2. AI assistant analyzes the problem context
3. AI assistant calls the AI Model Recommender tool with relevant context
4. AI assistant presents and explains the recommended models
5. AI assistant applies the models to provide a solution

## Tool Specification

The AI Model Recommender tool accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Required |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|
| context | string | Description of the programming task or problem | Yes |
| constraints | string[] | Any limitations or requirements | No |
| languages | string[] | Programming languages being used | No |
| projectScale | string | Size of the project (small, medium, large, enterprise) | No |
| returnAllMatches | boolean | Whether to return all applicable models | No |

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Class Design Problem

**User Query:**
> "I'm building an application with many similar UI components that need to share functionality, but I'm not sure if I should use inheritance or not."

**AI Assistant's Thought Process:**
- This seems to be about code organization and reuse in UI components
- It specifically mentions inheritance, suggesting a design pattern question
- It's likely related to front-end development

**Tool Call:**
```json
{
  "context": "Building an application with many similar UI components that need to share functionality, considering inheritance versus alternatives",
  "languages": ["javascript", "typescript"],
  "projectScale": "medium"
}
```

**Tool Response:**
```json
{
  "recommendedModels": [
    {
      "id": "composition_vs_inheritance",
      "name": "Composition vs. Inheritance",
      "definition": "A design principle that favors object composition over class inheritance for code reuse and flexibility.",
      "steps": [
        "Identify what functionality needs to be shared",
        "Consider if the relationship is truly 'is-a' (inheritance) or 'has-a' (composition)",
        "..."
      ],
      "aiMetadata": {
        "aiDescription": "Helps with designing flexible object relationships and code reuse strategies",
        "keywords": ["composition", "inheritance", "reuse", "flexibility", "design"],
        "domains": ["programming", "design", "architecture"],
        "codePatterns": ["class hierarchy with multiple inheritance needs", "code reuse across unrelated classes"],
        "aiPriority": 8
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "interface_segregation",
      "name": "Interface-Implementation Separation",
      "definition": "...",
      "..."
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "I primarily recommend Composition vs. Inheritance because it directly addresses your question about whether to use inheritance for sharing functionality between UI components...",
  "suggestedApproach": "Combined approach: \n1. Apply Composition vs. Inheritance: Identify what functionality needs to be shared. Then consider if the relationship is truly 'is-a' (inheritance) or 'has-a' (composition).\n2. Apply Interface-Implementation Separation: Define clear interfaces that specify what operations are available..."
}
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization

**User Query:**
> "My Python web scraper is getting slow when handling large amounts of data. How can I optimize it?"

**AI Assistant's Thought Process:**
- This is about performance optimization
- It's specifically for a web scraper handling large data
- The language is Python

**Tool Call:**
```json
{
  "context": "Optimizing a Python web scraper that's getting slow when handling large amounts of data",
  "languages": ["python"],
  "constraints": ["performance is critical", "handles large datasets"]
}
```

## Best Practices for AI Assistants

1. **Extract relevant context:** Analyze the user's query to identify the programming domain, languages, and specific challenges.

2. **Include constraints:** If the user mentions specific limitations or requirements, include these as constraints.

3. **Present models clearly:** When presenting recommended models to users, explain:
   - Why this model is relevant to their specific problem
   - Key steps to apply the model
   - How to avoid common pitfalls

4. **Combine models when appropriate:** Sometimes multiple models work best together. Explain how they complement each other.

5. **Learn from interactions:** If a user confirms a recommendation was helpful (or not), use this feedback to improve future recommendations.

## Conclusion

The AI integration layer enhances the ability of AI assistants to select and apply mental models for programming tasks. By providing AI-specific metadata and relevance scoring, it helps AI assistants make more accurate and contextual recommendations.
