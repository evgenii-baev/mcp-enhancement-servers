# MCP Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the MCP (Mental Clear Process) toolset. The documentation is designed to help developers, AI assistants, and users understand and effectively utilize the powerful thinking and problem-solving tools provided by MCP.

## Documentation Files

### Tool Documentation

- **[TOOLS_ARGUMENTS.md](TOOLS_ARGUMENTS.md)** - Comprehensive reference guide documenting all available MCP tools, their arguments, and usage examples. This is the primary reference for understanding the capabilities and proper usage of each tool in the MCP toolkit.

- **[TOOL_PRIORITY.md](TOOL_PRIORITY.md)** - Guide on the recommended order and priority of MCP tools when solving tasks. This document explains which tools to use first and how to combine them for optimal problem-solving workflows.

- **[MODEL_SELECTOR_USAGE.md](MODEL_SELECTOR_USAGE.md)** - Detailed guide specifically for the Model Selector tool, which helps choose the optimal architecture, design pattern, algorithm, or data structure for programming tasks.

### Project Documentation

- **[enhanced-roadmap.md](enhanced-roadmap.md)** - The development roadmap for the MCP project, outlining planned features, enhancements, and development priorities.

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **New Users**: Start with `TOOL_PRIORITY.md` to understand which tools to use in what order, then refer to `TOOLS_ARGUMENTS.md` for detailed information about each tool.

2. **AI Assistants**: Begin with `TOOL_PRIORITY.md` to learn the optimal tool selection process, then consult `TOOLS_ARGUMENTS.md` for specifics about tool arguments and constraints.

3. **Developers**: Review `enhanced-roadmap.md` for project direction and planned features, then dive into the specific tool documentation as needed for implementation details.

4. **Model Selection Tasks**: For any architecture, design pattern, or algorithm selection tasks, refer specifically to `MODEL_SELECTOR_USAGE.md` for detailed guidance.

## Best Practices

1. **Combine Tools**: For complex problems, use a combination of tools following the priorities outlined in `TOOL_PRIORITY.md`.

2. **Structured Approach**: Start with analysis tools, move to structured thinking tools, then to solution generation, and finally to implementation-specific tools.

3. **Task-Specific Selection**: Choose tools based on both the task type and the current stage of work as described in `TOOL_PRIORITY.md`.

4. **Documentation-Driven Development**: When extending the MCP toolkit, create or update the relevant documentation first to clarify the design and usage patterns.

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the MCP documentation:

1. Follow the established format for consistency
2. Include clear examples for each tool or feature
3. Update the relevant documentation files when adding or modifying tools
4. Ensure compatibility with AI assistant workflows
5. Test documentation clarity with new users
