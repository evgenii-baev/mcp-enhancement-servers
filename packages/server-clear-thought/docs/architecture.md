# MCP Clear Thought Server Architecture

## Overview

The Clear Thought Server provides a collection of thinking tools that help structure and enhance cognitive processes. These tools can be used for sequential thinking, applying mental models, debugging problems, analyzing feature requirements, and more.

## Modules and Components

### Core Modules

1. **Tool Interaction API**: Facilitates communication between different thinking tools.
2. **Thought Router**: Routes requests to appropriate thinking tools based on request characteristics.
3. **Incorporation System**: Integrates results from various tools to create richer outcomes.
4. **Tool Registry**: Central registry for all thinking tools.
5. **Thought Orchestrator**: Coordinates thinking processes across multiple tools.

### Interfaces

#### ThoughtData
Represents a single thought in sequential thinking:
```typescript
interface ThoughtData {
    thought: string              // The content of the thought
    thoughtNumber: number        // Position in sequence of thoughts
    totalThoughts: number        // Total number of thoughts expected
    isRevision?: boolean         // Whether this is a revision of a previous thought
    revisesThought?: number      // If a revision, which thought it revises
    branchFromThought?: number   // If branching, from which thought it branches
    branchId?: string            // Identifier for the branch
    needsMoreThoughts?: boolean  // Indicates if more thoughts are needed
    nextThoughtNeeded: boolean   // Whether another thought is needed
}
```

#### MentalModelData
Represents data for applying a mental model:
```typescript
interface MentalModelData {
    modelName: string   // Name of the mental model
    problem: string     // Problem to analyze with the mental model
    steps: string[]     // Steps of applying the model
    reasoning: string   // Reasoning process
    conclusion: string  // Conclusion from the model application
}
```

#### DebuggingApproachData
Represents data for a debugging approach:
```typescript
interface DebuggingApproachData {
    approachName: string  // Name of the debugging approach
    issue: string         // Issue to debug
    steps: string[]       // Steps of the debugging process
    findings: string      // Findings during debugging
    resolution: string    // Resolution of the issue
}
```

#### RequirementsAnalysisResult
Represents the result of analyzing feature requirements:
```typescript
interface RequirementsAnalysisResult {
    analysisId: string           // Unique identifier for the analysis
    featureId: string            // Identifier of the feature being analyzed
    timestamp: string            // When the analysis was performed
    summary: string              // Brief description of the feature
    complexityRating: number     // Complexity rating (1-5)
    priorityRating: number       // Priority rating (1-5)
    effortEstimate: number       // Effort estimate in person-days
    validatedRequirements: string[]  // Validated requirements
    potentialIssues?: Array<{    // Potential issues in requirements
        description: string
        severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
        relatedRequirements: string[]
        suggestedResolution?: string
    }>
    recommendedApproaches?: string[]    // Recommended technical approaches
    dependencies?: string[]             // Potential dependencies
    recommendedTechnologies?: string[]  // Recommended technologies
    technicalDetails?: string           // Technical details and constraints
    testingRecommendations?: string[]   // Testing recommendations
}
```

### Specialized Tools

#### FeatureAnalyzer
Analyzes feature requirements, estimates complexity and effort, and provides technical recommendations. It can:
- Validate and prioritize requirements
- Identify potential issues and contradictions
- Suggest implementation approaches and technologies
- Estimate development effort and complexity
- Provide testing recommendations

#### ServerBridge
Provides compatibility between original MCP servers and the new multi-level thinking architecture. It:
- Adapts requests from the original format to the new architecture
- Routes requests to the appropriate tools
- Handles different types of requests (mental models, sequential thinking, feature analysis, etc.)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing clients

## Processing Flow

1. Client sends a request to the server
2. Request is validated and routed to the appropriate tool
3. Tool processes the request and returns a result
4. Result may be incorporated with results from other tools
5. Final result is returned to the client

## Adding New Tools

To add a new thinking tool:
1. Define the tool's interfaces and data structures
2. Implement the tool's core functionality
3. Create metadata for the tool registry
4. Implement bridging functionality if needed
5. Register the tool with the orchestrator

## Future Enhancements

See the enhanced roadmap for planned future enhancements:
- Improved integration between tools
- Advanced orchestration with parallel processing
- Learning and optimization
- Extension API for third-party developers
