    description: `A tool that intelligently recommends the optimal mental model or algorithm for any problem.

üß† WHAT IT DOES:
This AI-powered tool analyzes your problem and recommends the perfect thinking approaches to solve it.
It matches problem characteristics with model strengths to find the ideal cognitive framework.

‚ö°Ô∏è WHY START HERE:
- Eliminates guesswork in choosing the right thinking approach
- Provides instant access to optimal problem-solving frameworks
- Delivers personalized recommendations with confidence scores
- Includes ready-to-use application instructions for each model
- Seamlessly integrates with other thinking tools

üîç HOW TO USE:
Simply describe your problem and optionally specify your goal and domain.
The tool will analyze your input and recommend the most effective thinking approaches.

Example: { "problem": "Our codebase has become difficult to maintain", "goal": "optimize" }

After receiving recommendations, use the specific tool for your chosen approach.`,
