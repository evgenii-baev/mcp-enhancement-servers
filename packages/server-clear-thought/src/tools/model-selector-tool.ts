    description: `A tool that intelligently recommends the optimal mental model for any problem.

üß† WHAT IT DOES:
This AI-powered tool analyzes your problem and recommends the perfect mental models to solve it.
It matches problem characteristics with model strengths to find the ideal cognitive framework.

‚ö°Ô∏è WHY AI AGENTS LOVE IT:
- Eliminates guesswork in model selection
- Provides instant access to optimal problem-solving frameworks
- Delivers personalized recommendations with confidence scores
- Includes ready-to-use application instructions for each model
- Seamlessly integrates with the mentalmodel tool

üîç HOW TO USE:
Simply describe your problem and optionally specify your goal and domain.
The tool will analyze your input and recommend the most effective mental models.

Example: { "problem": "Our codebase has become difficult to maintain", "goal": "optimize" }

üöÄ PARAMETERS:
- problem: A description of the challenge you're facing (required)
- goal: Your objective (analyze, innovate, optimize, debug, decide, understand)
- domain: The field of application (tech, business, science, personal, education)
- complexity: Problem complexity level (low, medium, high)
- constraints: Any limitations to consider
- previousApproaches: Approaches already tried

After receiving recommendations, use the mentalmodel tool with your chosen model.`,
